# Just let me build it

Voluntari.ly is based on the [MERN (MongoDB, Express, React+Redux, Node)](http://mern.io/) software stack but also uses next.js to keep things clean and simple.

and everything should work out of the box. There are two choices: 

1. install NodeJS and MongoDB and run locally.
2. install Docker and run in a container. 

## Install NodeJS and MongoDB and run locally.

### Prerequisites
You will need:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
You may already have it. Verify with `git --version` 

* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Verify this with `node -v` which should return a current version. e.g. v11.12.0

You will also need to be connected to the Internet and be prepared for some downloads. (sometimes corporate firewalls make this difficult - go get a coffee and use theirs.)

* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
or setup a [free account in the cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com) - but if you do this you will need to change the `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/vly-test` connection string in your environment or in package.json to point at your cloud URL.
  
For mac users `brew install mongodb` should be all you need to do.

* start the mongodb service

`mongod`

### Get the Voluntari.ly source code

    git clone https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2.git
    cd vly2
    npm install

npm install may take several minutes as it pulls in all the dependent packages. 

### Available Commands

1. `npm run dev` - starts the development server with hot reloading enabled

2. `npm run build` - bundles the code 

3. `npm run test` - start the test runner

4. `npm run start` - runs production server

5. `npm run check-coverage` - generates test coverage report 

6. `npm run lint` - runs standard to check for lint errors ( npm run fix to fix lint errors )


Once you see the message "Voluntari.ly is running on port: 3122! Be Awesome!" then you can open your browser at http://localhost:3122.

If you see the message "Please make sure Mongodb is installed and running!"  then go back and start mongod. 

Press control+C to exit the node application. 

## Install Docker and run in a container.
You can use this option if you quickly want to see what the application looks like.

You will need:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Get the source code

    git clone https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2.git
    cd vly2
    npm install

### Start the Containers

    docker-compose docker-compose.yml up -d --build

Note this may take a few minutes the first time you run it as it will download some images.
Also once the command returns the services are still starting up so it will be a minute before you can visit the webpage.

Note In order to stop the root folder filling up I moved all the docker files to the Docker Subfolder. You can either run from root using the -f path or cd to the Docker folder and run there. 


### You are in.
* Open your web browser at http://localhost:3122/

You will now be able to see the voluntari.ly application (if not then ask for help on our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/voluntarily/community) channel.

### Stopping
To halt the containers run:

    docker-compose down
